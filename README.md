# treescapes - Hack The North 2023
Aren't you tired of all that clogged-up real estate in your bookmark bar?!? Don't you wish you had an easier way to navigate that sea of links your professors expect you to keep on top of?? WELL, HOW ABOUT WE THROUGH SOME TREES AT IT TO SPRUCE THINGS UP!!

## Install
- We haven't submitted it to the Chrome store yet so for now you need to download the whole repo and then load the unpack extension into Chrome with developer mode enabled. Hopefully, we will get around to getting this approved
- I recommend binding the extension to CTRL + Space in Chrome to make it more useful in the daily workflow

## Devtools
- Built with JS, CSS, HTML, the Chrome Extention API, and innumerable amounts of sleep deprivation!
- Presentation designed with ___RACKET___
